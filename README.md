	abstract = {We present GuideScan2 for memory-efficient, parallelizable construction of high-specificity CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) databases and user-friendly gRNA/library design in custom genomes. GuideScan2 analysis identified widespread confounding effects of low-specificity gRNAs in published CRISPR knockout, interference and activation screens and enabled construction of a ready-to-use gRNA library that reduced off-target effects in a novel gene essentiality screen. GuideScan2 also enabled the design and experimental validation of allele-specific gRNAs in a hybrid mouse genome.Competing Interest StatementS.W.L. is an advisor for and has equity in the following biotechnology companies: ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Faeth Therapeutics, Blueprint Medicines, Geras Bio, Mirimus Inc. and PMV Pharmaceuticals.
